## Architecture Details

### Core Design Principles

1. **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between SDK and ION internals
2. **Minimal Overhead**: Thin wrapper that preserves ION's performance
3. **Thread Safety**: All operations protected with appropriate synchronization
4. **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup with explicit lifecycle management
5. **Error Propagation**: Consistent error codes with human-readable messages

### Memory Management Strategy

- **Bundle Payloads**: Use ION's ZCO system for zero-copy efficiency
- **Metadata**: Automatic allocation/deallocation with reference counting
- **Registration**: Dynamic arrays with capacity management
- **Cleanup**: Explicit destruction functions with automatic resource release

### Thread Safety Implementation

- **Global Context**: Protected by mutex for all registration operations
- **Bundle Operations**: ION's internal thread safety mechanisms
- **Callback Functions**: User responsibility for thread-safe implementations
- **Resource Access**: Atomic operations where possible, locks where necessary

### Integration Strategy

The BP-SDK integrates with ION-DTN at multiple levels:

1. **API Level**: Direct calls to ION's public APIs (`bp_send`, `bp_receive`, etc.)
2. **Internal Level**: Access to ION's internal structures for advanced features
3. **Storage Level**: Integration with SDR for persistent configuration
4. **Memory Level**: Use of ION's memory management for efficiency

## Future Extensions
