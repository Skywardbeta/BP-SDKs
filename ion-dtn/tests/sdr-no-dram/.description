PURPOSE: Testing the functionality configFlags value 2, running with the SDR heap only in files (no copy in RAM).  We simply configure two nodes with configFlags set to 2, send 30 bundles from one node to the other, and verify that bundles arrive and are delivered. We detect the delivery of these bundles by looking for 'z' watch characters in stdout at the receiver.
